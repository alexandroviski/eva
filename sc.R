# so what do we model?

# first out is activity, an unobserved categorical, though we can have a small
# set of true observations to start off with, and grow that over time by asking
# the user to confirm a whole day at once.

# see here a total bullshit, just to get you thinking
activity ~ weight + mood_score + sleep_hrs

# we actually arent gonna use weight, mood, sleep for predicting activity,
# probably, they are for the user's own purposes kinda. for now. well i can
# definitely use sleep and maybe mood, but later.

# bigger question: how do we use data from different datasets in a model? we do
# have continuous information on sleep so we could represent it as a boolean
# variable in any dataset: in other words, just add a column, don't add any
# rows.

# but say a measurement on mood was taken at 11:34 and we want to model
# soemthing at 11:37. we have probably a huge dataset of buffer-changes, and if
# there is a "mood" variable, it will mostly be NAs. Or even all NA, since no
# buffer change will coincide exactly with the measurement.

# This is where most of the magic happens. When unsure, just don't classify,
# leave a NA. Also, the categories don't need to map to your clock categories.
# Ideally the categories here are slighly more granular. Imagine you change the
# clock categories later, these should remain meaningful to the modelling
# machine because they carve reality at the joints. If you have time to kill,
# see https://www.greaterwrong.com/tag/thingspace for inspiration. Additionally note that you can make categories that are conceptual subsets of another even if you don't specify that relation. The category
# names (after the tilde ~) are just suggestive and meaningless. Consider
# giving them truly meaningless names, like "fnord" or "1", "2"... so you don't
# fool yourself.
# Keep in mind that this list is parsed sequentially, the first match wins.
# Look at the printout of d to see what kind of info exists.
